This is the structure I use for any new Unity project I start.

```

    Animation
    Art
        Materials
        Models
        Sprites
    Audio
        Music
        Sounds
    Editor
    Fonts
    Prefabs
    Scenes
        TestScenes
    Scripts
        Game
        Managers
        UI
        Utilities
    Settings
```

## Usage

Clone this project and copy the folder into your new Unity project, use the commands in the `create_project_structure.sh` file.
